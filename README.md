# Scrollview-swift

n iOS development using Swift, UIScrollView is a versatile view class that allows users to scroll and view content larger than the visible area. Its primary purpose is to enable users to interact with content that doesn't fit entirely within the bounds of the screen.

## Here are some common use cases and purposes of UIScrollView in iOS Swift development:

 1. Displaying large content: When you have content (such as images, text, or other UI elements) that exceeds the screen size, UIScrollView allows users to scroll through this content to 
    view it entirely.

 2. Form and Data Entry: If you have a form or data entry fields that extend beyond the screen size, placing them within a UIScrollView allows users to scroll down to fill out all the necessary information.

 3. Zooming: UIScrollView supports zooming functionality, which can be useful when displaying images or other content that users may want to zoom in on for closer inspection.

 4. Paging: You can implement paging behavior using UIScrollView, allowing users to swipe left or right to navigate between different pages or sections of content.

 5. Dynamic Content: If your content is dynamic and its size changes at runtime, UIScrollView can adapt to accommodate the changing content size, allowing users to scroll through the updated content.

6. Nested Content: You can nest other UI elements, such as UIImageView, UILabel, or custom views, within a UIScrollView to create complex layouts where certain elements need to be scrollable while others remain fixed.

## Follow below steps to make your ViewController as a scroller
## ScrollView:
1. take a scrollView and give zero constraints from the top, bottom, leading, and trailing to view(VC).
2. click on scrollView and uncheck the layout guides.
3. take a view and give it zero constraints from the top, bottom, leading, and trailing to scrollView and also give height 1000 at the same time.
4. give equal width to view(VC).
5. take another view and give it to the top leading bottom and height add more views to give it constraints.
